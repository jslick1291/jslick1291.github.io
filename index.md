# Jason Slick
My name is Jason Slick I am San Carlos Apache from San Carlos, Arizona. I am an online student at the San Carlos Apache College and live in Maricopa, Arizona which is located just outside the city of Phoenix. I am pursuing an Associatesfo Applied Science in Computer Information Systems
and I am taking the GIS class online at the college so I am excited for this opportunity to learn something new in the tech and science field. I do have a an Associates of Applied Science degree in Computer Infromation Technology from Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado I actually graduated last May
and I felt that I needed to learn more in the technology field so I went back to school at a Tribal College which I have found to have more opporunities for Native American students. I started my college journey in 2020 with zero computer knowledge and after four years
I graduated. I recently went to Rapid City, South Dakota in March for AIHEC and I placed 3rd in the indivdual Web Page Design which made me feel more confident in what I can accomplsih moving forward.
