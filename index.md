My name is Jason Slick, and I am a San Carlos Apache who is from San Carlos, Arizona. I am pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Information Systems as an online student at San Carlos Apache College. Currently I live in Maricopa, Arizona, which is located just outside of Phoenix. I am taking an online GIS class and I am excited to learn something new in the tech and science fields. I do have an Associate of Applied Science degree in Computer Information Technology from [Colorado Christian University](https://www.ccu.edu/) in Lakewood, Colorado, which I got last May. However, I felt that I needed to learn more technology, so I went back to school at a Tribal College which has more opportunities for Native American students. I started my college journey in 2020 with zero computer knowledge, and after four years, I graduated. I went to Rapid City, South Dakota in March for AIHEC (Ameircan Indian Higher Education Consortium) 2025 and I placed 3rd in the individual Web Page Design competition, which makes me feel more confident in what I can accomplish.
